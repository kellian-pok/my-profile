			<h2 id="title">MY EDUCATION</h2>
			<h4 id="education">From 2021 to 2024, I attended the Sainte Jeanne-Elisabeth Highschool situated in Paris. I studied particularly mathematics, economics and English. I also decided to learn different foreign languages such as Spanish or Chinese.</h4>
			
			<h4 id="education">I had the opportunity to do a work placement as part of my high school education. Working for the French retailer Rue du Commerce, I had my first glimpse of corporate life and the different tasks assigned to each department. I was able to develop my graphic design skills using PhotoShop and Canva.</h4>

			<h4 id="education">I passed my final exam called "Baccalauréat" in June 2024. Currently, I attend Paris - La Defense IESEG School of Management's Grande Ecole Program where I study economics, management and law. This course's duration is 5 years so I will get a Master degree in 2029.</h4>

			<h4 id="education">Alongside my studies, I'm working as a multi-skilled team member at BioBurger Issy-Val de Seine, where I'm given several assignments. I have to pick up and serve customers, as well as operate the various machines. In this restaurant, the whole team is motivated and helps each other out. The fact that there's a small age gap contributes to a friendly atmosphere.</h4>

			<h4 id="education">For 4 years, I worked as a graphic designer for a leisure association in Seine-et-Marne, TaiChi Sports Loisirs. Creating flyers, managing their website and running events helped me to become more organized and creative.</h4>
